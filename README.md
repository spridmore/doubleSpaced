### Obstacles / Lessons
---
Having elements in a view reanimate in response to user action was difficult for me. I was familiar with animation timing/execution when a view would change or when a controller would reload, but having a static view provide a dynamic interface was challenging. jQuery event handling was crucial for getting the site to run smoothly.
